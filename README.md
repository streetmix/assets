# assets

streetmix assets like logos and stuff that may be used around the streetmix ecosystem. consider this a [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md) of sorts.

the `main` branch is hosted via github pages automatically, so files can be accessed like so: https://streetmix.github.io/assets/logos/streetmix-logo-880x280.png for example

the `master` branch still exists for backwards compatibility purposes, in case anything out there refers to a raw asset URL directly and hasn't been updated yet.
